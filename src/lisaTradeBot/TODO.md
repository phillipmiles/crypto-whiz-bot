## WHAT TO DO ABOUT MULTIPLE TRADES IN THE SAME MARKET!!?!?!?!
Theres a delay in things happening which cant be avoided. So it's possible that a stoploss is hit on one trade at the same time that another trade triggers the take proift order of another.

Solution:
Stop trades in the same market happening on the same account id. Until a time when I shift from setting take profit orders on fill to instead create a sell order only AFTER the respecitve target has been hit.
